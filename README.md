# Josiah's connect 4 ai  

This is my best attempt at a connect 4 ai (just for fun)
---

This is a work in progress, whenever I have spare time. I plan to implement the AI by evauating every position, then choosing the best path
Ideally I'll be able to implement Alpha-beta pruning first, then I'll move on to searching good moves first, then I'll ensure it remembers positions so it doesn't reevaluate the same position twice during one search. 

Likely I won't get a lot of this done, but if I can make an AI that uses alpha beta pruning and can beat me in connect 4. I'll call that a mad win
